# X-ray-polymetry-with-Artificial-Intelligence-XPAI-.


XPAI is an Artificial Intelligence project designed to analyze X-ray polarimetry data, inspired by NASAâ€™s IXPE (Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer) mission. Its goal is to make astrophysical research and visualization more accessible through open-source tools.


ðŸŒŒ Scientific Context

NASAâ€™s IXPE mission studies the high-energy universe through X-ray observations to explore extreme objects such as:

Black holes

Neutron stars

Pulsars

Supernova remnants


This project replicates some of IXPEâ€™s fundamental concepts, applying Machine Learning to:

Analyze X-ray images

Detect polarization patterns

Simulate datasets and outcomes

---

ðŸ¤– What XPAI Does

Processes and classifies X-ray polarimetry data

Trains Deep Learning models for automated analysis

Generates interactive data visualizations

Runs entirely on Google Colab (no local setup required)

---

ðŸš€ Tech Stack

Python (NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas)

TensorFlow / PyTorch (neural network training)

Astropy (astronomy utilities)

Google Colab (cloud execution)
